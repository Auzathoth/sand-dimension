# sand-dimension

This datapack adds a custom dimension to Minecraft 1.16+, which is comprised of desert, desert hills and desert lakes biomes, with the default block set to sandstone.

Players in survival can access the dimensions using the Transdimensional Jumper, which can be obtained be renaming an Ender Chest to "contains sand".

Using the Transdimensional Jumper will teleport the user back and forth between the overworld or the sand dimension. Due to certain limitations, if the same location in the other dimension is water, the player will fall from a great height into it.
